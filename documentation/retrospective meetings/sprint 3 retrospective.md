# SPRINT 3 RETROSPECTIVE MEETING

DATE: 07 June 2022

## MINUTES:

### What was the initial goal for sprint 3?

-  Build on the functionality of the 2nd release.
-  Implementing a 2 player wordle game with 2 boards on the screen.
-  Implementing testing for the functionality of the game.
-  Creating a database for the words, game log information and user information.

### What was the actual outcome of sprint 3?

-  The majority of the goals were achieved, with the words database and game log information being the only ones that were not achieved.
-  The 3rd sprint was meant to end on the 31st of May 2022. However, this ended up being pushed to the 6th of June 2022 and thus becoming the 3rd and final sprint.

### What were the reasons for sprint 3â€™s outcomes?

-  There was a severe lack of time management which then resulted in us not having any pull requests for the original deadline therefore leading us to extend it.
- Lack of time management was due to an increase in other commitments for all group members. 
-  The stories that were created were more complex than expected and would take us far longer to complete than the time we had for the original deadline.

### What could have been done to improve the sprint 3 release?

-  Better planning and time management.
-  Adding additional functionality.
-  Making a word database instead of the word list as this caused many issues for testing.
-  We could have had better coding practices.
- Implement the database to store input words when users are playing the game.
- Improve the layout of the multiplayer games for a better user experience.
- Incorporate a register page before login. 
- Improve the login page to have alerts for when there is an invalid input for passwords and usernames. 
- Incorporate more security and cookies for the web application.
- Can fix minor bugs that occur while playing the different game modes. 


### How did we work together as a team?

-  There was some miscommunication due to the fact that there was loadshedding and thus we ended up having to meet quite late into the evening.
-  We had meetings on Teams often to discuss issues we were having with the code and to see if anyone was available to to help.
-  Overall, communication could have been improved but we worked well as a team in getting the deliverables ready to submit by the end of Sprint 3.

## MULTI-WORDLE SPRINT 3 RETROSPECTIVE:

### What the team did well?

-  Majority of the goals were achieved by the end of this final sprint.
-  The team was always ready to help with other members' issues.
- The team motivated each other to achieve the necessary goals for this sprint. 
- For several issues the team collaborated to fix bugs. 

### What went wrong?

-  The sprint went over the due date by 13 days and the release was postponed.
-  We did not manage to add additional functionality to the game.
-  The words are not in a database nor does the database contain the user inputs from the game (game log), only the user information (username and password).

### What could be improved?

- Better time management and planning.
- Better communication with members. 
- Details of each task should be discussed so that everyone understands what is required of them to do.
- Complex issues can be more evenly distributed between team members or broken down into smaller tasks to be more achievable.
- User game logs can be added to the database.
- The word list can also be contained within a database. 

### The approach for future team projects

-  Plan out all the issues from the start and evenly divide them amongst team members in terms of difficulty and number.
-  Aim to do testing for each pull request that has to do with the functionality of the game.
-  Better time management.
-  Selecting a leader to check up on everything and assign members to certain issues when there are problems.

### What is the sprint velocity achieved for sprint 3? Show calculations.

-  Formula:

`Sum of all story points / no. of sprints`

`= (1 + 7 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 20) / 3`

`= 28.7`
