# ADR 1: Multi-Wordle Sprint 1, The Basics.

## Context

As a software development team employing the agile development process, based on scrum, we made decisions on how we will approach the project in its entirety and what needs to be done to complete the first sprint. <br>

## Decisions

We decided that we will plan the requirements for each sprint at the beginning of every week/sprint. User stories will be generated as part of <br>
the planning process, so that they are specific to each sprint. User story maps will be updated weekly and Retrospectives will be committed <br> after each release. We have also decided to complete each sprint and release every Sunday until the 7th of June 2022. The functionality of <br> the game and app will be improved upon with each sprint. <br>

For the first sprint we have decided to create a basic version of Wordle. The basic version of the app only allows one player to play the game.<br> This basic version includes the display of the title of the game, the grid and the keyboard, allowing the player to guess a five letter word <br> in six guesses, letting the player guess a valid five letter word that exists in a list of five letter words (not visible to the player), <br> generating a random word from that list of words, checking if the <br> player guessed the word correctly by comparing their guessed word to <br> the random word, and notifying the player if they have guessed correctly or not. We have also decided to allow the user to input letters <br> by clicking on the keyboard displayed on the screen with their mouse. There is also an about page acknowledging the authors of the app for <br> users to view and an instructions page which describes the rules of the game. <br>

## Status

Accepted <br>

## Consequences

By creating user stories for every sprint, we are ensuring that user stories are more specific to each sprint's requirements. The full <br> functionality of the app/game will be achieved incrementally. By deciding to create a functional game for one player in the initial stages, <br> it makes it easier to build upon in the following stages. <br>
